# Single-Nucleus RNA-seq Reveals No Increase in Brain-Resident T Cells in Alzheimer’s Disease Prefrontal Cortex or Hippocampus
   
## Background/Overview

The goal of this project was to examine the abundance of Brain-Resident T cells in Alzheimer's Disease(AD) prefrontal cortex(PFC) and hippocampus to better understand the role of the adaptive immune system in AD pathology. This git hub serves as the companion to the paper for ease of reproducibility of results.


## Analysis

###  Recapitulation of previously described microglial subtype expansion
This analysis replicates a previously identified expansion of 

###  No expansion of T cells in PFC in AD in the ROSMAP dataset

###  No increase in interferon signaling genes in AD

###  No expansion of T cells in AD in SEA-AD DLPFC

###  Replication of CD8+ T cell expansion in SEA-AD MTG

###  No expansion of T cells in the hippocampus in AD in the ROSMAP dataset
